# CaffeineMC Reforged

This is an unnoficial port of all the CaffeineMC Mods from Fabric to Forge

Currently it consists of Sodium, Phosphor and Hydrogen. Later I will add Lithium and Iris.

For more in depth info on the features look at the Reforged CF Pages or the Official Mod Pages.


Progress:

Sodium: 100%

Phosphor: 100%

Hydrogen 99%

Iris: 75%

Lithium: 0%

In the future, these mods may be packaged into one Mod of an undecided name, however this isn't final.
